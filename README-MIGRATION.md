# Migration from Mock Data to Supabase

This document outlines the steps taken to migrate the application from using mock data and localStorage to exclusively using Supabase for data persistence.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Mock Data**
   - Eliminated all hardcoded mock arrays (`mockServices`, etc.) from hook files
   - Removed fallback to mock data in all services
   - Deleted `initLocalStorageData.ts` which was used to populate localStorage with sample data
   - Deleted redundant sample data scripts (`seedSampleData.js`, `setup-supabase.js`, and `scripts/createTestServices.js`)

2. **Added Database Seeding Script**
   - Created `scripts/seedSupabase.js` to properly seed the Supabase database
   - Script creates tables if they don't exist and populates them with initial data
   - Only seeds tables that are empty - won't overwrite existing data
   - Replaces all previous sample data scripts with a single comprehensive solution

3. **Updated Hooks**
   - All hooks now properly handle empty states by returning empty arrays
   - Added proper error handling without mock data fallbacks
   - Removed localStorage persistence mechanisms

## How to Use

### 1. Initial Setup

Run the database seeding script to populate your Supabase database with initial data:

```bash
npm run seed
```

This will:
- Create required tables if they don't exist
- Populate tables with initial data (only if tables are empty)
- Create necessary views for inventory management
- Refresh the Supabase schema cache

### 2. Development

When developing:
- Use `npm run dev` as normal
- The app will now connect directly to Supabase for all data
- Empty states will be properly handled in the UI

## Benefits of This Migration

1. **Data Consistency**: All users see the same data since it's stored in a central database
2. **Real-time Updates**: Changes made by one user are immediately visible to all others
3. **Improved Testing**: Testing against real database behavior rather than mock implementations
4. **Simplified Code**: Removed complex fallback mechanisms and conditional logic
5. **Better Error Handling**: More consistent approach to errors and empty states
6. **Reduced Confusion**: Single source of truth for data without multiple sample data files

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Empty Data**: If no data appears, run `npm run seed` to populate the database
2. **Schema Issues**: If you see database schema errors, check the Supabase SQL Editor to verify table structures
3. **Authentication Problems**: Ensure your Supabase URL and API keys are correctly set in your environment variables
