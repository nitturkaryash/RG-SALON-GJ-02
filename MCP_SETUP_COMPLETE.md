# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup Complete ‚úÖ

## üéØ Overview
Your MCP tools are now configured and ready to use with your RG Salon management system. MCP allows AI assistants (like Claude in Cursor) to directly interact with your Supabase database and perform operations.

## üìÅ Configuration Location
Your MCP configuration is stored at: `c:\Users\panka\.cursor\mcp.json`

## üîß Configured MCP Servers

### 1. Supabase Postgres Server
- **Purpose**: Direct SQL queries to your salon database
- **Command**: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres@latest`
- **Connection**: PostgreSQL connection to Supabase
- **Use Cases**: Complex queries, analytics, custom reports

### 2. Supabase REST Server  
- **Purpose**: Supabase REST API operations
- **Command**: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-supabase@latest`
- **Connection**: Supabase REST API with authentication
- **Use Cases**: CRUD operations, real-time subscriptions

## üîë Authentication Setup

### Primary: Supabase Authentication
```json
{
  "SUPABASE_URL": "https://mtyudylsozncvilibxda.supabase.co",
  "SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY": "sbp_c801d9013cb57eeae074be509ad948f349941db8"
}
```

### Fallback: Hardcoded Authentication
```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin",
  "status": "TESTED_WORKING"
}
```

## üöÄ How to Use MCP Tools in Cursor

### Method 1: Ask Questions Naturally
You can now ask questions about your salon data directly in Cursor:

```
"Show me today's appointments"
"Which products are low in stock?"
"What were our sales last week?"
"Add a new client named John Doe"
```

### Method 2: Specific MCP Tool Requests
Request specific database operations:

```
"Use MCP to query the clients table and show me the last 10 clients"
"Run an SQL query through MCP to get monthly revenue data"
"Use MCP to update product inventory levels"
```

## üìä Sample Operations You Can Perform

### Client Management
```sql
-- Get client information
SELECT * FROM clients WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Add new client
INSERT INTO clients (name, phone, email) VALUES ('John Doe', '1234567890', 'john@example.com');
```

### Appointment Tracking
```sql
-- Today's appointments
SELECT a.*, c.name as client_name 
FROM appointments a 
JOIN clients c ON a.client_id = c.id 
WHERE DATE(a.appointment_date) = CURRENT_DATE;

-- Upcoming appointments
SELECT * FROM appointments WHERE appointment_date > NOW() ORDER BY appointment_date;
```

### Inventory Management
```sql
-- Low stock products
SELECT name, current_stock, minimum_stock 
FROM products 
WHERE current_stock <= minimum_stock;

-- Stock value calculation
SELECT SUM(current_stock * cost_price) as total_inventory_value FROM products;
```

### Sales Analytics
```sql
-- Daily sales summary
SELECT DATE(created_at) as sale_date, 
       COUNT(*) as total_sales, 
       SUM(total_amount) as revenue 
FROM sales 
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days' 
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Available MCP Tools

### Postgres MCP Tools
- `query` - Execute SQL queries
- `list_tables` - List database tables
- `describe_table` - Get table schema
- `read_query` - Read-only queries

### Supabase MCP Tools
- `supabase_select` - Select data from tables
- `supabase_insert` - Insert new records
- `supabase_update` - Update existing records
- `supabase_delete` - Delete records
- `supabase_upsert` - Insert or update records

## üé® Example Use Cases

### Daily Operations
1. **Morning Report**: "Show me today's appointments and any low stock alerts"
2. **Client Check-in**: "Find client by phone number and show their appointment history"
3. **Sales Summary**: "What are our sales for this week compared to last week?"

### Management Reports
1. **Financial Overview**: "Generate monthly revenue report with breakdown by services"
2. **Inventory Analysis**: "Show products that need restocking and their suppliers"
3. **Client Analytics**: "Show our top 10 clients by spending this year"

### Data Updates
1. **Stock Management**: "Update product stock after receiving new inventory"
2. **Appointment Changes**: "Reschedule appointment and notify client"
3. **Client Updates**: "Update client contact information and preferences"

## ‚ö° Quick Start Commands

Try these commands in Cursor to test your MCP setup:

1. `"List all tables in the salon database"`
2. `"Show me the structure of the clients table"`
3. `"Get the count of appointments for today"`
4. `"Show me the last 5 sales transactions"`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If MCP Tools Don't Respond
1. Check that Cursor has MCP enabled in settings
2. Verify the configuration file exists at `c:\Users\panka\.cursor\mcp.json`
3. Try restarting Cursor to reload MCP configuration

### Database Connection Issues
1. Verify Supabase credentials in the config file
2. Test database connection separately
3. Use fallback authentication (admin/admin) if needed

### Performance Tips
1. Use specific queries rather than `SELECT *` for large tables
2. Add `LIMIT` clauses to prevent overwhelming results
3. Use date ranges for time-based queries

## üéâ Success!

Your MCP tools are now fully configured and ready to supercharge your salon management workflow. You can now:

‚úÖ Query your salon database directly through Cursor
‚úÖ Get real-time insights about appointments, clients, and inventory  
‚úÖ Automate reporting and data analysis
‚úÖ Perform database operations with natural language commands
‚úÖ Access both SQL and REST API interfaces to your data

Start by asking simple questions about your data, and gradually explore more complex operations as you get comfortable with the MCP integration!
