# Multi-Expert Appointment Services Display Fix

## Issue Description
When passing services from appointments with multiple stylists assigned, the services were passing properly to POS but not all services were showing in orders. The stylists were showing properly, but there were issues with:
1. Services display and aggregation
2. Incorrect price calculation for multi-expert services
3. Wrong quantity display in orders list

## Root Cause
The issue was in the Orders.tsx file in multiple areas:

1. **Incorrect Deduplication**: The aggregation logic was removing valid services
2. **Price Calculation**: Services with multiple experts weren't showing combined pricing correctly
3. **Quantity Display**: The orders list was counting services from all experts instead of actual service quantities

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Service Aggregation Logic** (`src/pages/Orders.tsx` lines 254-275):
- Removed incorrect deduplication that was filtering out valid services
- Preserved all services from multi-expert appointments
- Added proper aggregation marker (`aggregated_multi_expert: true`)

### 2. **Enhanced Service Display** (`src/pages/Orders.tsx` lines 1890+):
- Added null checking for services array
- Enhanced service display with stylist information for multi-expert orders
- Improved error handling

### 3. **Fixed Price Calculation for Multi-Expert Services**:
- **Unit Price**: Now correctly sums prices from all experts working on the same service
- **Total Price**: Calculates correctly as sum of all expert contributions
- **Example**: Basic Haircut with 2 experts @ ₹150 each = Unit Price ₹300, Total ₹300

### 4. **Fixed Quantity Display in Orders List**:
- **Multi-Expert Orders**: Aggregates services by name to avoid counting duplicates
- **Quantity Calculation**: Shows actual service quantities, not expert count
- **Display Logic**: Correctly shows "2 types, 2 total qty" instead of "4 types, 4 total qty"

### 5. **Added Console Logging** (`src/hooks/usePOS.ts`):
- Added debugging logs to track service processing
- Updated CreateServiceData interface to include category property

## Technical Implementation

### Service Aggregation for Multi-Expert Orders:
```typescript
// Before: Incorrect deduplication and price manipulation
services: filteredUniqueServices.map(service => ({
  ...service,
  price: (service.price || 0) * expertsCount // WRONG
}))

// After: Proper aggregation preserving all services
services: appointmentOrders.reduce((allServices: any[], order) => {
  if (order.services && Array.isArray(order.services)) {
    order.services.forEach(service => {
      allServices.push({
        ...service,
        stylist_id: order.stylist_id,
        stylist_name: order.stylist_name
      });
    });
  }
  return allServices;
}, [])
```

### Price Calculation in Order Details:
```typescript
// Aggregate prices from all experts working on same service
serviceAggregation[serviceName].unit_price += price;
serviceAggregation[serviceName].total_price += (price * quantity);
```

### Quantity Display in Orders List:
```typescript
// For multi-expert orders, deduplicate by service name
const serviceAggregation: Record<string, { quantity: number; count: number }> = {};
order.services.forEach((service: any) => {
  if (serviceAggregation[serviceName].count === 0) {
    serviceAggregation[serviceName].quantity = quantity;
  }
});
```

## Results

✅ **Services Display**: All services now show correctly in orders  
✅ **Multi-Expert Support**: Proper aggregation with stylist information  
✅ **Price Accuracy**: Correct pricing reflecting all expert contributions  
✅ **Quantity Display**: Accurate service counts in orders list  
✅ **Stylist Information**: Clear indication of all stylists involved  
✅ **UI Indicators**: Visual markers for multi-expert orders  

## Example Results

**Before:**
- Basic Haircut: Unit Price ₹150, Total ₹150 (incorrect)
- Orders List: "4 types, 4 total qty" (wrong count)

**After:**
- Basic Haircut (2 experts): Unit Price ₹300, Total ₹300 (correct)
- Hair Spa (2 experts): Unit Price ₹1000, Total ₹1000 (correct)
- Orders List: "2 types, 2 total qty" (correct count)

The system now correctly handles multi-expert appointments with proper service aggregation, accurate pricing, and correct quantity displays.
