# User-Based Data Access Implementation Guide

## Overview

Your salon management system has been updated to implement **Row Level Security (RLS)** and **user-specific data access**. This means that when different users login with different credentials, they will only see and manage their own salon's data.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Authentication Integration
- Added `checkAuthentication()` function that verifies user authentication before any database operation
- Modified all data hooks (`useClients`, `useStylists`, `useServices`, `useProducts`, `useAppointments`) to include authentication checks
- Added automatic `user_id` assignment when creating new records

### 2. Database Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** is enabled on all main tables:
  - `clients`
  - `stylists` 
  - `services`
  - `products`
  - `appointments`
  - `pos_orders`
  - `inventory_purchases`
  - And more...

### 3. User Profile Management
- Added comprehensive user profile functions in `authUtils.ts`
- Automatic profile creation when users first login
- Support for both `user_profiles` and `admin_users` tables

## How It Works

### Data Isolation
1. **Every database record** now includes a `user_id` field that references the authenticated user
2. **RLS policies** automatically filter all queries to show only data belonging to the current user
3. **No code changes needed** in components - the filtering happens at the database level

### User Authentication Flow
1. User logs in with their email/password
2. Supabase authentication verifies credentials
3. All subsequent database queries are automatically filtered by `user_id`
4. User can only see and modify their own salon's data

## Testing Different User Accounts

### Step 1: Create Test Users

You can create test users in two ways:

#### Option A: Through Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ Users
2. Click "Add User" 
3. Create users like:
   - `salon1@test.com` / `password123`
   - `salon2@test.com` / `password123`
   - `salon3@test.com` / `password123`

#### Option B: Through the Application
1. Use the registration form in your app (if available)
2. Each user will automatically get their own profile

### Step 2: Test Data Isolation

1. **Login as salon1@test.com**:
   - Create some clients (e.g., "John Doe", "Jane Smith")
   - Add some stylists (e.g., "Alice Stylist", "Bob Stylist")
   - Create some services (e.g., "Haircut", "Color")
   - Add some products to inventory

2. **Logout and login as salon2@test.com**:
   - You should see an empty dashboard
   - No clients, stylists, services, or products from salon1
   - Create different data (e.g., "Mike Client", "Sarah Stylist")

3. **Switch back to salon1@test.com**:
   - You should only see salon1's data
   - None of salon2's data should be visible

### Step 3: Verify User Profile Information

The system displays user information in the sidebar:
- **User Avatar**: Shows first letter of email
- **Salon Name**: Automatically generated or customizable
- **Email**: Current user's email
- **GST Settings**: Per-user tax configuration

## Database Schema Changes

### New Fields Added
All main tables now have:
```sql
user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

### RLS Policies
Each table has policies like:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "user_access_[table]" ON public.[table]
  FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.user_id());
```

### Automatic Triggers
Triggers automatically set `user_id` when inserting new records:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER set_user_id_[table] BEFORE INSERT ON public.[table]
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.set_user_id();
```

## Benefits

### 1. Complete Data Isolation
- Each salon/user operates independently
- No risk of data mixing between different businesses
- Secure multi-tenant architecture

### 2. Scalable SaaS Model
- System can support unlimited salon businesses
- Each pays for their own subscription
- Independent data management

### 3. Automatic Security
- No manual filtering needed in application code
- Database-level security prevents data leaks
- Consistent across all features

## Troubleshooting

### If You Don't See User-Specific Data
1. **Check Authentication**: Ensure user is properly logged in
2. **Verify RLS**: Check that RLS policies are enabled in Supabase
3. **Check User ID**: Verify that `auth.user_id()` function exists
4. **Database Migration**: Ensure all tables have `user_id` columns

### If Data Appears Empty for New Users
This is expected behavior! New users start with empty data and must create their own:
- Clients
- Stylists  
- Services
- Products
- Appointments

### Common Issues
1. **"No data found"**: Normal for new users
2. **Authentication errors**: Check Supabase connection
3. **Missing user_id**: Ensure database migration completed

## Next Steps

### For Production Deployment
1. **User Registration**: Implement proper user registration flow
2. **Billing Integration**: Add subscription management
3. **User Onboarding**: Guide new users through initial setup
4. **Data Migration**: Help existing users migrate their data

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create multiple test user accounts
- [ ] Verify data isolation between users
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Confirm user profile information displays correctly
- [ ] Test logout/login cycles
- [ ] Verify no cross-user data leakage
