# 🏢 Salon Management SaaS Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Business Model Overview
Your salon management software is now configured as a **multi-tenant SaaS application** where:
- Each customer (salon owner) has completely isolated data
- You can manage all customers from your admin panel
- Customers pay subscription fees to use your software

## 🛡️ Data Isolation Architecture

### ✅ Implemented Features:
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** on all tables
- **user_id column** added to all business tables
- **Automatic triggers** for user_id assignment
- **Admin panel** for customer management

### 🔐 How Data Isolation Works:
```sql
-- Each table has policies like this:
CREATE POLICY "user_access_appointments" ON public.appointments
  FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.user_id());

-- This ensures Customer A can only see their own data
-- Customer B cannot access Customer A's appointments, clients, etc.
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Production Environment Setup
```bash
# Deploy to production hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
npm run build
# Deploy the built files to your hosting platform
```

### 2. Domain & SSL Setup
- Purchase your domain (e.g., `mysalonmanager.com`)
- Configure SSL certificate
- Point domain to your hosting platform

### 3. Supabase Production Configuration
- Keep your current Supabase project for production
- Database is already configured with user isolation
- Monitor usage and upgrade Supabase plan as needed
