## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import EnhancedPaymentSection from './components/EnhancedPaymentSection';

function CheckoutPage() {
  const [paymentAmounts, setPaymentAmounts] = useState({
    cash: 0,
    credit_card: 0,
    debit_card: 0,

  return (
    <EnhancedPaymentSection
      paymentAmounts={paymentAmounts}
      setPaymentAmounts={setPaymentAmounts}
      calculateTotalAmount={() => orderTotal}
      activeClientMembership={membershipDetails}
      onPaymentValidation={(isValid, message) => {
        // Handle validation feedback
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Split Payment Processing

```typescript
import { 
  validateSplitPayment, 
  processSplitPayment, 
  generatePaymentReceipt 
} from './utils/splitPaymentUtils';

// Validate payment
const validation = validateSplitPayment(paymentAmounts, orderTotal, membershipBalance);

if (validation.isValid) {
  // Process payment
  const paymentDetails = processSplitPayment(paymentAmounts, orderId, customerName);
  
  // Generate receipt
  const receipt = generatePaymentReceipt(orderId, paymentAmounts, customerName);
}
```
