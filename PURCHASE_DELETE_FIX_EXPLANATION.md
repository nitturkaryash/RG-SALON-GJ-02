# Purchase Delete Stock Recalculation Fix

## Problem Identified

When you delete a purchase record, the `current_stock_at_purchase` values for ALL subsequent purchase records must be recalculated because the deleted stock affects the running total.

### Current Issue Example:
**Product**: COPACABANA BRAZILIAN PROTEIN

**Before Deletion:**
- Purchase 1 (2025-07-16): 5 units → current_stock_at_purchase = 5 ✅
- Purchase 2 (2025-07-24): 1 unit → current_stock_at_purchase = 6 ✅

**After Deletion of Purchase 1 (5 units):**
- Purchase 2 (2025-07-24): 1 unit → current_stock_at_purchase = 1 ❌ (should be 1, not 6)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Corrected Stock Calculation Function**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_current_stock_at_purchase(
  product_name_param TEXT,
  date_param DATE
)
```
- Now uses correct table names (`purchase_history_with_stock`, `sales`, `inventory_consumption`)
- Properly handles date comparisons with `::date` casting
- Includes user_id filtering for data isolation

### 2. **Enhanced Recalculation Function**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION recalculate_stock_after_purchase_delete(
  deleted_product_name TEXT,
  deleted_date DATE,
  deleted_quantity INTEGER
)
```
- **Step 1**: Calculate running total for all purchases BEFORE the deleted date
- **Step 2**: Update all purchases ON or AFTER the deleted date with new running totals
- **Step 3**: Subtract the deleted quantity from all subsequent records

### 3. **Complete Delete Function**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_purchase_with_stock_recalculation(purchase_id_param UUID)
```
- Deletes the purchase record
- Recalculates stock for all subsequent records
- Updates product master stock
- Returns detailed results

## How It Works

### Example: Deleting Purchase 1 (5 units)

**Step 1: Calculate Running Total Before Deletion**
- Purchase 1: 5 units → Running total = 5
- Purchase 2: 1 unit → Running total = 6

**Step 2: Delete Purchase 1**
- Remove Purchase 1 from database

**Step 3: Recalculate for Remaining Records**
- Purchase 2: 1 unit → New running total = 1 (not 6)

**Step 4: Update Product Master**
- Total stock = 1 unit (was 6, now 1)

## Key Features

### ✅ **Proper Running Total Calculation**
- Each purchase record shows the cumulative stock at that point in time
- Deletion correctly affects all subsequent records

### ✅ **User Authorization**
- All operations use Surat's user ID: `3f4b718f-70cb-4873-a62c-b8806a92e25b`
- Proper data isolation maintained

### ✅ **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive exception handling
- Automatic trigger re-enabling on errors
- Detailed error messages

### ✅ **Performance Optimization**
- Uses indexes for fast queries
- Minimal database operations
- Efficient batch updates

## Usage

### Delete a Purchase:
```sql
SELECT delete_purchase_with_stock_recalculation('purchase-uuid-here');
```

### Test Stock Calculation:
```sql
SELECT test_stock_calculation('Product Name');
```

## Verification

After deletion, verify that:
1. **Product Master Stock**: Updated correctly
2. **Purchase History**: All subsequent records have correct `current_stock_at_purchase`
3. **Running Totals**: Each record shows cumulative stock at that purchase date
4. **Data Integrity**: No orphaned records or inconsistencies

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

The fix has been applied to your Supabase database and is ready for use. All purchase deletions will now properly recalculate stock for all subsequent records.
