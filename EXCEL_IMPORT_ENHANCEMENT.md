# Excel Import Enhancement for Orders

## Overview
The Orders page now features an enhanced Excel import function that automatically detects and handles both product and service data formats.

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Automatic Format Detection
- **Product Import**: Detected by the presence of 'PRODUCT NAME' column
- **Service Import**: All other formats are treated as service imports
- Real-time feedback shows which format was detected

### 2. Improved Date Handling
- Proper Excel serial date conversion (handles Excel dates like 45748 → April 1, 2025)
- Fallback to current date if date conversion fails

### 3. Enhanced Product Import Structure
The product import now correctly handles:

#### Expected Product Columns:
- `Sr No.` - Serial number
- `Date` - Excel date format (serial number)
- `Guest Name` - Customer name
- `PRODUCT NAME` - Product name
- `HSN CODE` - HSN code for tax purposes
- `TYPE` - Product type
- `Guest Number` - Customer phone number
- `Staff` - Staff member who handled the sale
- `Category` - Product category
- `Qty` - Quantity sold
- `Unit Price` - Price per unit
- `Discount` - Discount amount
- `Taxable Value` - Value before tax
- `Cgst` - Central GST amount
- `Sgst` - State GST amount
- `Total` - Final total amount

#### Data Processing:
- Calculates total tax as CGST + SGST
- Generates unique order numbers with format `PROD-{timestamp}-{serial}`
- Stores detailed service information as JSON including HSN codes and tax breakdowns
- Defaults to cash payment method for products
- Marks orders as completed and walk-in

### 4. Enhanced Service Import Structure
For service imports, the system expects traditional service columns and processes them accordingly.

## Usage

### From the Orders Page:
1. Click "Import Excel Data" button
2. Select your Excel file (.xlsx or .xls)
3. The system automatically detects the format and shows a notification
4. Processing begins with real-time success/failure feedback
5. Orders list refreshes automatically after import

### File Format Support:
- Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
- Automatic format detection
- Proper error handling and logging

## Test Results
The enhanced import function has been tested with the PRODUCT APRIL-2025.xlsx file and successfully:
- Converted 73 rows of product data
- Handled Excel date conversion (45748 → 2025-04-01)
- Processed all product fields correctly
- Generated proper order structures

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Row-by-row error handling prevents batch failures
- Detailed error messages with row data for troubleshooting

## Legacy Support
The previous `handleProductImport` function is retained as "Import Products (Legacy)" for backward compatibility.

## Technical Implementation
- Uses XLSX library for Excel parsing
- Maintains compatibility with existing order structure
- Proper JSON serialization of services and payments
- UUID generation for unique order IDs
- Date conversion utilities handle Excel date format properly
