-- Supabase Seed File
-- This file has been emptied of mock data to allow you to create all data through the application interface.
-- When you add services, products, stylists, etc. through the salon management system,
-- they will be stored in the Supabase database directly.

-- No pre-populated data will be inserted when the database is initialized.
-- This ensures you start with a clean system and only have the data you specifically create.

-- If you need to add initial data for testing or development,
-- you can either:
-- 1. Add INSERT statements here
-- 2. Use the application's interface to create the data
-- 3. Run the database seeding script with: npm run seed (if available)
