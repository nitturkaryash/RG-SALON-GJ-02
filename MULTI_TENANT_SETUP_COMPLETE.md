# Multi-Tenant Authentication System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Your R&G Salon management system now has complete multi-tenant functionality. Each user who logs in with different credentials will only see their own data across all tables in the system.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Security (Row Level Security)
- ✅ **RLS Enabled**: Row Level Security is enabled on ALL tables
- ✅ **User Isolation**: Every table now has a `user_id` column
- ✅ **Automatic Policies**: Users can only:
  - View their own data
  - Insert data tagged with their user_id
  - Update their own data
  - Delete their own data

### 2. Authentication System
- ✅ **Supabase Auth**: Proper Supabase authentication instead of custom auth table
- ✅ **Email/Password Login**: Users login with email and password
- ✅ **User Registration**: New users can create accounts
- ✅ **Session Management**: Proper session handling and logout

### 3. Data Assignment
- ✅ **Existing Data**: All existing data assigned to current user (pankajhadole05@gmail.com)
- ✅ **Auto-Assignment**: New records automatically get user_id from authenticated user
- ✅ **Triggers**: Database triggers ensure user_id is always set correctly

### 4. Frontend Integration
- ✅ **Updated Login**: Login now uses Supabase authentication
- ✅ **Registration Page**: New users can sign up
- ✅ **Auth Context**: Proper authentication state management
- ✅ **Helper Functions**: Utility functions for secure database operations

## How It Works

### User Login Process
1. User enters email and password on `/login`
2. System authenticates via Supabase Auth
3. User session is created and stored
4. All database queries are automatically filtered by user_id

### Data Isolation
```sql
-- Example: When User A queries appointments, they only see their data
SELECT * FROM appointments; -- Only shows records where user_id = 'user-a-id'

-- When User B queries the same table
SELECT * FROM appointments; -- Only shows records where user_id = 'user-b-id'
```

### New Data Creation
```typescript
// When creating new appointments, user_id is automatically set
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('appointments')
  .insert({
    client_id: 'some-client-id',
    start_time: '2024-01-01 10:00:00',
    // user_id is automatically set to current user via trigger
  });
```

## Database Schema Changes

### Tables with RLS Policies
All the following tables now have complete user isolation:
- `appointments` - User's appointments only
- `clients` - User's clients only
- `services` - User's services only
- `stylists` - User's stylists only
- `inventory_products` - User's inventory only
- `sales` - User's sales only
- `pos_orders` - User's orders only
- And ALL other tables in the system

### Security Policies Applied
Each table has 4 policies:
1. **SELECT**: Users can view their own rows
2. **INSERT**: Users can insert rows with their user_id
3. **UPDATE**: Users can update their own rows
4. **DELETE**: Users can delete their own rows

## Frontend Components Updated

### Authentication Components
- **Login Page** (`src/pages/Login.tsx`): Updated to use Supabase auth
- **Register Page** (`src/pages/Register.tsx`): New registration form
- **Auth Context** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`): Proper session management

### Utility Functions
- **Auth Utils** (`src/utils/supabase/authUtils.ts`): Helper functions for secure operations
  - `insertWithAuth()` - Insert with automatic user_id
  - `selectWithAuth()` - Select user's data only
  - `updateWithAuth()` - Update user's data only
  - `deleteWithAuth()` - Delete user's data only

## Testing the System

### Test User Isolation
1. **Current User**: pankajhadole05@gmail.com (has all existing data)
2. **Create New User**: Go to `/register` and create a new account
3. **Login as New User**: Login with new credentials
4. **Verify Isolation**: New user will see empty dashboard (no data)
5. **Create Data**: Add appointments, clients, etc. as new user
6. **Switch Users**: Login as different users to confirm data separation

### Verification Steps
```sql
-- Check data distribution by user
SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as appointment_count
FROM appointments 
GROUP BY user_id;

-- This will show different counts for different users
```

## Current Data Status
- **Total Appointments**: 1 (assigned to pankajhadole05@gmail.com)
- **Total Clients**: 4,192 (assigned to pankajhadole05@gmail.com)
- **Total Services**: 1 (assigned to pankajhadole05@gmail.com)

## User Management

### Creating New Users
1. Go to `/register`
2. Enter email, password, optional salon name
3. Account is created via Supabase Auth
4. Email verification may be required
5. User can then login and access their isolated data

### Login URLs
- **Login**: `/login`
- **Register**: `/register`
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard` (protected, requires authentication)

## Security Features

### Database Level
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- User-specific data filtering
- Automatic user_id assignment
- Secure triggers preventing data tampering

### Application Level
- Supabase session management
- Protected routes
- Automatic logout on session expiry
- Secure API calls with user context

## Notes for Developers

### Adding New Tables
When adding new tables, ensure you:
1. Add `user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)` column
2. Enable RLS: `ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
3. Create user isolation policies
4. Add trigger for automatic user_id assignment

### Using Auth Helper Functions
```typescript
// Instead of direct Supabase calls, use helper functions
import { insertWithAuth, selectWithAuth } from '../utils/supabase/authUtils';

// Insert with automatic user_id
const newClient = await insertWithAuth('clients', {
  full_name: 'John Doe',
  phone: '123-456-7890'
});

// Select user's data only
const userClients = await selectWithAuth('clients');
```

## Troubleshooting

### If User Can't See Data
1. Check if user is properly authenticated
2. Verify user_id is set on records
3. Check RLS policies are active
4. Ensure triggers are working

### If Data Appears for Wrong User
1. Check user_id assignment
2. Verify RLS policies
3. Check authentication context

## Success Confirmation ✅

The multi-tenant system is now fully operational. Each user logging in with different credentials will have their own isolated salon management system with their own:
- Appointments
- Clients  
- Services
- Stylists
- Inventory
- Sales data
- All other business data

The system is secure, scalable, and ready for multiple salon owners to use independently.
