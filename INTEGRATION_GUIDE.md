## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Key Changes Made

```typescript
import EnhancedPaymentSection from '../components/EnhancedPaymentSection';
import { validateSplitPayment, convertToSplitPaymentData } from '../utils/splitPaymentUtils';
```

#### 2. State Management Enhancement
```typescript
// Enhanced payment validation state
const [paymentValidation, setPaymentValidation] = useState<{isValid: boolean; message?: string}>({
  isValid: false
});

// Payment validation callback for EnhancedPaymentSection
const handlePaymentValidation = useCallback((isValid: boolean, message?: string) => {
  setPaymentValidation({ isValid, message });
}, []);
```

#### 3. Component Integration
```typescript
<EnhancedPaymentSection
  paymentAmounts={paymentAmounts}
  setPaymentAmounts={setPaymentAmounts}
  isSplitPayment={isSplitPayment}
  setIsSplitPayment={setIsSplitPayment}
  walkInPaymentMethod={walkInPaymentMethod}
  setWalkInPaymentMethod={setWalkInPaymentMethod}
  calculateTotalAmount={calculateTotalAmount}
  activeClientMembership={activeClientMembership || undefined}
  onPaymentValidation={handlePaymentValidation}
/>
```

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Payment Method Configuration

To customize payment methods, edit `PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIG` in `EnhancedPaymentSection.tsx`:

```typescript
const PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIG = {
  upi: {
    maxAmount: 200000, // Change UPI limit
    processingFee: 0,  // Add UPI fee if needed
  },
  // ... other methods
};
```

### Styling Customization

Update colors and themes in the component's `sx` props:

```typescript
sx={{
  borderColor: isActive ? '#custom-color' : 'divider',
  bgcolor: isActive ? '#custom-bg' : 'background.paper',
}}
```

## 🔧 Membership Payment Logic (Updated)

### How Membership Payments Work

The enhanced system now correctly implements membership payments as **deductions from the bill** rather than additions to payment:

#### Calculation Flow:
1. **Total Bill Amount**: ₹1,680 (example)
2. **Less: Membership Payment**: -₹1,000 (deducted from member's balance)
3. **Client to Pay**: ₹680 (remaining amount)
4. **Payment Methods**: Client pays ₹680 using cash/cards/UPI/etc.

#### Key Features:
- **Auto-Freeze**: When membership is selected, maximum available balance is automatically used
- **Balance Deduction**: Amount is deducted from client's membership balance
- **Split Payment**: Remaining amount can be split across multiple payment methods
- **Real-time Validation**: Shows "Client to Pay" amount accurately

#### Example Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Partial Membership Coverage**
- Bill: ₹1,500
- Membership Available: ₹1,000
- Membership Used: ₹1,000
- Client to Pay: ₹500 (via cash/cards)

**Scenario 2: Full Membership Coverage**
- Bill: ₹800
- Membership Available: ₹1,500
- Membership Used: ₹800
- Client to Pay: ₹0 (fully covered)

**Scenario 3: No Membership**
- Bill: ₹1,200
- Membership Available: ₹0 or not a member
- Client to Pay: ₹1,200 (full amount via payment methods)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Payment Validation Not Working**
   - Ensure `onPaymentValidation` callback is properly connected
   - Check that `calculateTotalAmount` returns correct values

2. **Membership Balance Not Showing**
   - Verify `activeClientMembership` is passed correctly
   - Check membership data structure matches `ActiveMembershipDetails`

3. **Split Payment Not Saving**
   - Ensure order creation uses the enhanced payment data
   - Check database schema supports split payment fields

### Debug Steps

1. Check browser console for payment validation messages
2. Verify payment amounts are updating in state
3. Test with different payment combinations
4. Validate membership balance calculations
