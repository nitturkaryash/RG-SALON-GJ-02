# Purchase Delete Stock Recalculation Fix

## Issue Description
When deleting an old purchase entry that had stock, the current stock values were not being properly updated for all entries in the purchase history. The system was only updating entries that came after the deleted date, but not properly recalculating the current stock for entries that came before the deleted purchase.

## Root Cause
The `recalculate_stock_after_purchase_delete` function was only processing purchase records with dates >= the deleted date, missing the fact that all current stock calculations need to be updated when a purchase is removed from the history.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified `recalculate_stock_after_purchase_delete` Function
- **Before**: Only updated records with `date >= deleted_date`
- **After**: Updates ALL purchase records for the same product (both before and after the deleted date)

### 2. Key Changes Made:
1. **Removed date filter**: Changed from `WHERE product_id = deleted_product_id AND date >= deleted_date` to `WHERE product_id = deleted_product_id`
2. **Improved calculation**: Now properly calculates current stock by considering all purchases, sales, and consumption up to each record's date
3. **Added product name lookup**: Ensures we use the correct product name for calculations
4. **Better error handling**: Added null check for product name

### 3. How It Works Now:
1. When a purchase is deleted, the function:
   - Removes the purchase from `purchase_history_with_stock`
   - Updates ALL remaining purchase records for that product
   - Recalculates current stock for each record based on:
     - Sum of all purchases up to that date (minus the deleted purchase)
     - Sum of all sales up to that date
     - Sum of all consumption up to that date
   - Updates the product master stock quantity
   - Records the change in stock history

### 4. Expected Behavior:
- **Before deletion**: Purchase history shows current stock values
- **After deletion**: All entries show updated current stock values that properly reflect the removal of the deleted purchase
- **Entries above deleted entry**: Will show reduced current stock values
- **Entries below deleted entry**: Will also show updated current stock values
- **Product master**: Stock quantity is reduced by the deleted purchase quantity

## Testing
Use the `test_purchase_delete_function.sql` script to verify the functionality:
1. Check purchase history before deletion
2. Delete a purchase using `delete_purchase_with_stock_recalculation()`
3. Verify all current stock values are properly updated
4. Confirm product master stock is reduced

## Files Modified:
- `purchase_delete_stock_recalculation.sql` - Main function updates
- `test_purchase_delete_function.sql` - Test script for verification
- `PURCHASE_DELETE_STOCK_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Usage:
```sql
-- Apply the updated functions to your database
-- Then use the delete function:
SELECT delete_purchase_with_stock_recalculation('purchase-uuid-here');
```
