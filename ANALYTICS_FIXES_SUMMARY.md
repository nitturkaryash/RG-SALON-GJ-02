# Analytics Dashboard Fixes - Complete Summary

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. X-Axis Display in Charts - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: X-axis labels were cutting off and not displaying properly in sales trends and other analytics charts.

**Root Cause**: Charts lacked proper X-axis configuration for label rotation, font size, and truncation.

**Solution**:
```tsx
// Enhanced X-axis configuration
x: {
  ticks: {
    maxRotation: 45,
    minRotation: 0,
    maxTicksLimit: 10,
    font: { size: 11 },
    callback: function(value: any, index: any, values: any) {
      const label = this.getLabelForValue(value);
      return label.length > 8 ? label.substring(0, 8) + '...' : label;
    }
  },
  grid: {
    display: true,
    color: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
  }
}
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Labels now rotate at 45° for better readability
- ✅ Long labels are truncated with "..." to prevent overlap
- ✅ Maximum of 10 ticks to prevent overcrowding
- ✅ Improved font size and grid display
- ✅ Enhanced interaction modes for better UX

### 2. Staff Incentive System - NEW ✅

**Implementation**: Complete configurable incentive system with industry standards.

**Features Added**:
- **Toggle Control**: Enable/disable incentive system
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Set minimum revenue requirements
- **Performance Metrics**: Weighted scoring system
- **Industry Standards**: Excellent, Good, Average performance levels
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Real-time incentive calculations

**Settings Available**:
```tsx
incentiveSettings: {
  enabled: boolean;
  minimumRevenue: number;        // Default: ₹10,000
  incentiveRate: number;         // Default: 10%
  evaluationPeriod: 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'quarterly';
  performanceMetrics: {
    revenueWeight: 0.6,         // 60% weight
    appointmentWeight: 0.3,     // 30% weight
    efficiencyWeight: 0.1,      // 10% weight
  };
  industryStandards: {
    excellent: 90,              // 90+ score = Excellent
    good: 75,                   // 75+ score = Good
    average: 50,                // 50+ score = Average (eligible)
  };
}
```

**Dashboard Display**:
- ✅ Performance ratings (Excellent, Good, Average, Needs Improvement)
- ✅ Performance scores (0-100)
- ✅ Incentive eligibility badges
- ✅ Suggested incentive amounts
- ✅ Industry standard compliance indicators

### 3. Critical Stock Items from Product Master - ENHANCED ✅

**Problem**: Critical stock items were not showing properly and lacked product master details.

**Solution**: Enhanced inventory analytics with product master integration.

**Query Enhancement**:
```sql
SELECT inventory_balance_stock.*,
       product_master.name,
       product_master.description,
       product_master.category,
       product_master.mrp_incl_gst
FROM inventory_balance_stock
INNER JOIN product_master ON inventory_balance_stock.product_id = product_master.id
```

**Enhanced Display**:
- ✅ Product name from product master
- ✅ Category classification
- ✅ Product description (truncated)
- ✅ MRP and current value calculations
- ✅ Product ID for tracking
- ✅ Fallback handling for missing product master data

**Critical Stock Features**:

evaluationPeriod: 'monthly'      // Monthly evaluation
performanceMetrics: {
  revenueWeight: 0.6,            // Revenue is primary (60%)
  appointmentWeight: 0.3,        // Volume is secondary (30%)
  efficiencyWeight: 0.1,         // Efficiency is tertiary (10%)
}
industryStandards: {
  excellent: 90,                 // Top performers
  good: 75,                      // Above average
  average: 50,                   // Minimum for incentive eligibility
}
```

## 📈 Business Intelligence Improvements

### Performance Calculation
```typescript
// Advanced performance scoring algorithm
const calculatePerformanceScore = (revenue: number, appointments: number, efficiency: number) => {
  const revenueScore = Math.min((revenue / minimumRevenue) * 100, 100);
  const appointmentScore = Math.min((appointments / 20) * 100, 100);
  const efficiencyScore = Math.min(efficiency, 100);
  
  return (
    revenueScore * revenueWeight +
    appointmentScore * appointmentWeight +
    efficiencyScore * efficiencyWeight
  );
};
```

### Incentive Eligibility Logic
```typescript
const incentiveEligible = 
  settings.enabled && 
  revenue >= settings.minimumRevenue &&
  performanceScore >= settings.industryStandards.average;

const suggestedIncentive = incentiveEligible ? 
  Math.round(revenue * (settings.incentiveRate / 100)) : 0;
