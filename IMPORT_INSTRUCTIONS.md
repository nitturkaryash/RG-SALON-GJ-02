# Import April 2025 Service Data

## Summary
I have successfully extracted and processed your April 2025 service data from the Excel file `SHEETS/SERVICE APRIL-2025.xlsx`. The data contains **790 service records** with the following information:

- **Invoice Numbers**: 1-790 (some invoices have multiple services)
- **Date Range**: March 31, 2025 to April 2025
- **Services**: Hair cuts, styling, treatments, spa services, etc.
- **Clients**: Various customer names and phone numbers
- **Staff**: Multiple stylists and service providers
- **Payment Methods**: Card, GPay, Cash

## Files Generated
1. `extract_excel_data.js` - Initial extraction script
2. `fix_excel_data.js` - Fixed script with proper date/tax calculations
3. `import_fixed_april_services.sql` - Complete SQL import file (790 records)
4. `import_april_batch_1.sql` - Test batch (20 records)

## Multi-Tenant Architecture Implemented âœ…
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- **User isolation** - each user sees only their own data
- **Profile-based authentication** using user ID: `3f4b718f-70cb-4873-a62c-b8806a92e25b`
- **Views updated** with user filtering for multi-tenant support

## Data Structure
The extracted data follows this format:
```sql
(invoice_number, date_time, client_name, client_phone, stylist_name, service_name, service_price, quantity, discount_percent, tax_percent, payment_method)
```

## Sample Data
```sql
('1', '2025-03-31 18:38:50', 'Zarna Javeri', '9824770184', 'Rupesh Mahale', 'Hair Cut With Senior Hairdresser (Male)', 1000, 1, 0, 18, 'card'),
('2', '2025-03-31 18:38:50', 'Tarun Vatiani', '9904079784', 'Vandan Gohil', 'Hair Cut With Senior Hairdresser (Male)', 1000, 1, 0, 18, 'gpay'),
('2', '2025-03-31 18:38:50', 'Tarun Vatiani', '9904079784', 'Vandan Gohil', 'Beard Trim', 400, 1, 0, 18, 'gpay')
```

## How to Import the Data

### Option 1: Use the Complete SQL File
1. Open `import_fixed_april_services.sql`
2. Copy the entire content
3. Execute it in your Supabase SQL editor or database client
4. The script will automatically:
   - Create missing clients, stylists, and services
   - Group services by invoice number
   - Insert POS orders with proper JSON structure
   - Avoid duplicates

### Option 2: Manual Import via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Paste the SQL content from `import_fixed_april_services.sql`
4. Execute the query
5. Check the results in the pos_orders table

### Option 3: Batch Import (Recommended for large datasets)
Since the authentication system is preventing automated import, you can:
1. Split the data into smaller batches
2. Import each batch manually
3. Use the `import_april_batch_1.sql` as a template

## Expected Results
After successful import, you should have:
- **790 service records** in the pos_orders table
- **Multiple clients** created in the clients table
- **Multiple stylists** created in the stylists table
- **Various services** created in the services table
- **Proper invoice grouping** with multiple services per invoice
- **Multi-tenant isolation** - all data associated with your user ID

## Verification
After import, run this query to verify:
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_orders_imported,
    COUNT(DISTINCT client_name) as unique_clients,
    COUNT(DISTINCT stylist_name) as unique_stylists,
    SUM(total) as total_revenue
FROM pos_orders 
WHERE user_id = '3f4b718f-70cb-4873-a62c-b8806a92e25b'::uuid
AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

## Notes
- All data is automatically associated with your user ID for multi-tenant isolation
- Duplicate invoices are prevented by the import script
- Services are properly grouped by invoice number
- Payment methods are normalized (card, gpay, cash)
- Tax calculations are corrected from the original Excel data
- Dates are properly converted from Excel serial format

The import scripts are ready to use and will handle all the data processing automatically!
