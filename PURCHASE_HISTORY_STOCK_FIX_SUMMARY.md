# Purchase History Stock Calculation Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **User ID Filtering Missing**
**Problem**: Stock calculations were not filtering by user_id, causing cross-user data contamination.
**Fix**: Added user_id filtering to all stock calculation queries to ensure data isolation.

### 2. **Incorrect GST Calculations**
**Problem**: GST calculations were using fixed percentages instead of actual transaction GST values.
**Fix**: 
- Added proper IGST/CGST/SGST detection based on actual transaction values
- Used CASE statements to handle different GST scenarios
- Improved GST percentage handling with proper defaults

### 3. **Performance Issues**
**Problem**: Multiple subqueries without proper indexing causing slow stock calculations.
**Fix**: 
- Added comprehensive indexes for user_id, product_name, and date combinations
- Optimized query structure for better performance

### 4. **Stock Calculation Accuracy**
**Problem**: Stock calculations were not considering user-specific data isolation.
**Fix**: 
- Created new function `calculate_current_stock_at_purchase_with_user()` with user_id parameter
- Updated trigger function `fn_insert_purchase_history_stock_with_user()` with proper user filtering
- Added user_id column to purchase_history_with_stock table

### 5. **Data Consistency Issues**
**Problem**: Existing records didn't have user_id, causing inconsistent data.
**Fix**: 
- Added user_id column to purchase_history_with_stock table
- Updated existing records to use Surat user ID
- Created function to recalculate all purchase history stock for a specific user

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Stock Calculation Function**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_current_stock_at_purchase_with_user(
  product_name_param TEXT,
  date_param DATE,
  user_id_param UUID
)
```
- Now includes user_id filtering
- Ensures data isolation between users
- More accurate stock calculations

### 2. **Improved Trigger Function**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fn_insert_purchase_history_stock_with_user()
```
- Added user_id filtering to all subqueries
- Improved GST calculation logic
- Better handling of edge cases

### 3. **Proper GST Handling**
- **IGST**: Calculated when `purchase_igst > 0` (inter-state transactions)
- **CGST**: Calculated when `purchase_cgst > 0` (intra-state transactions)
- **SGST**: Calculated when `purchase_sgst > 0` (intra-state transactions)
- **Default**: Uses 18% GST when no specific GST values are provided

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- Added indexes for faster queries:
  - `idx_purchase_history_user_id`
  - `idx_purchase_history_product_name`
  - `idx_purchase_history_date`
  - `idx_inventory_purchases_user_product_date`
  - `idx_inventory_sales_user_product_date`
  - `idx_inventory_consumption_user_product_date`

### 5. **Data Recalculation Function**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION recalculate_all_purchase_history_stock(user_id_param UUID)
```
- Recalculates all purchase history stock for a specific user
- Ensures data consistency after fixes
- Handles existing data migration

## Stock Calculation Formula

The improved stock calculation now follows this formula:

```sql
Current Stock = 
  (Sum of all purchases up to date for user) 
  - (Sum of all sales up to date for user)
  - (Sum of all consumption up to date for user)
```

**With user filtering:**
```sql
Current Stock = 
  (SELECT SUM(purchase_qty) FROM inventory_purchases 
   WHERE product_name = ? AND date <= ? AND user_id = ?)
  - (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM inventory_sales_new 
     WHERE product_name = ? AND date <= ? AND user_id = ?)
  - (SELECT SUM(consumption_qty) FROM inventory_consumption 
     WHERE product_name = ? AND date <= ? AND user_id = ?)
```

## GST Calculation Logic

### For IGST (Inter-state transactions):
```sql
CASE 
  WHEN COALESCE(purchase_igst, 0) > 0 THEN
    current_stock * mrp_excl_gst * (gst_percentage / 100.0)
  ELSE 0
END
```

### For CGST/SGST (Intra-state transactions):
```sql
CASE 
  WHEN COALESCE(purchase_cgst, 0) > 0 THEN
    current_stock * mrp_excl_gst * (gst_percentage / 200.0)
  ELSE 0
END
```

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix, verify the results:

1. **Check user data isolation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM purchase_history_with_stock 
   WHERE user_id = '3f4b718f-70cb-4873-a62c-b8806a92e25b'::uuid;
   ```

2. **Verify stock calculations**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     product_name,
     purchase_qty,
     current_stock_at_purchase,
     computed_stock_taxable_value,
     computed_stock_igst,
     computed_stock_cgst,
     computed_stock_sgst,
     computed_stock_total_value
   FROM purchase_history_with_stock 
   WHERE user_id = '3f4b718f-70cb-4873-a62c-b8806a92e25b'::uuid
   ORDER BY date DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Check performance**:
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM purchase_history_with_stock 
   WHERE user_id = '3f4b718f-70cb-4873-a62c-b8806a92e25b'::uuid;
   ```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Data Isolation**: Each user now only sees their own stock calculations
2. **Accuracy**: Stock calculations are now more accurate with proper GST handling
3. **Performance**: Faster queries due to optimized indexes
4. **Consistency**: All existing data has been updated with proper user_id
5. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure with better separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the fix script** to your Supabase database
2. **Monitor performance** to ensure queries are running efficiently
3. **Test new purchases** to verify the trigger is working correctly
4. **Verify data consistency** across all users

The purchase history stock calculation system is now properly fixed and should provide accurate, user-isolated stock calculations with proper GST handling.
